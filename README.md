# UN5.2C-TINY V1.3

This is a JBC-specific soldering control board derived from the latest UniSolder 5.2C.
It can be installed in a much smaller case and supplied by 24VDC SMPS to save more rooms.
Many metal case with 88X38mm front panel and lots chinese-cloned STM32 "T12" soldering station are compatible with
this modified version of UN5.2, which further reduces the cost and complexity of this project.
